# Hosting a Static website on AWS

# Problem Statement:
A client wants me to host his school website (The information is hard code and I have access to the code file) on AWS.
# Requirements:
-The website should be accessible with a domain name
-The website should be available globally and load fast
-The customer wants a cost effective but efficient solution
-Also, the website should be secured with https.

# Solution Statement:
- I'll create an Amazon S3 bucket to hold the static website files and an Amazon CloudFront distribution to serve
the website globally. Amazon Route 53 will manage the website domain name, and AWS Certificate Manager to provide
a valid SSL/TLS certificate while making sure I still within the customer's budget.

# Services for the project:
-Amazon S3
-Amazon CloudFront
-Amazon Route 53
-AWS Certificate Manager
